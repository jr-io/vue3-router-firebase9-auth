# Vue3 + vue-router + firebase9 authentication
This is an example application for restricting route(s) based on whether or not a user is logged in.

## Warning!!
This app only serves as an example for "how" to use vue-router alongside firebase/auth, and should not be used in producton.
If you want to use this as a template for production, you'll need to add more verification methods to increase security.
